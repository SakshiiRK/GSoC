Machine Learning Model Optimization Framework
[Administrative notes](#administrative-notes)

------------

Prerequisites:

Strong understanding of Python programming.
Familiarity with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Basic knowledge of optimization techniques and hyperparameter tuning.
Experience with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization.
Description
The goal of this project is to develop an open-source framework that optimizes machine learning models for performance and deployment. The framework will provide tools for hyperparameter tuning, model pruning, and quantization to reduce computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, the framework will include visualization tools for understanding optimization trade-offs and pre-built pipelines for deployment.

Key features:

Automated hyperparameter tuning using algorithms like Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.
Model pruning and quantization to reduce model size for deployment.
Visualization of metrics like accuracy, loss, and latency trade-offs.
Integration with TensorFlow and PyTorch for seamless model optimization.
